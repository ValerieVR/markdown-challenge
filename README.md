## A funny story
When I was a kid the ball I was playing with fell on a car and the car's alarm went off.
I panicked and ran back into my house.
I wouldn't leave my house for the rest of the day because I was scared that the police would come and arrest me.
The next day I kept looking out the window to see if the police would show up.

### TL;DR
Kids and their imagination :rofl:
