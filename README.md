 ## A funny story
 When I was a kid the ball I was playing with fell on a car and the car's alarm went off.
 I panicked and ran back into my house.
 I wouldn't leave my house for the rest of the day because I was scared that the police would come and arrest me.
 The next day I kept looking out the window to see if the police would show up.

 ### TL;DR
 Kids and their imagination :rofl:
